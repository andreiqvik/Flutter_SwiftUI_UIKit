# Demo apps for GDG Helsinki at Qvik Oy on 27.09.2022

## Intro
This repository contains the code of a demo note taking app built with three different technologies:
* Flutter (crossplatform)
* SwiftUI (iOS)
* UIKit (iOS)

The code of the demo app is meant to accompany the ***"Comparing Apples to Oranges. (Battle of Flutter, SwiftUI and UIKit)"*** presentation at the GDG Helsinki meetup organized on 27.09.2022 at Qvik Oy. The slides can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d013GgHntN2OLFrVkb3JzxOGkanuMyUAKSPcxVvwe64/edit#slide=id.gf3c71e86c4_0_0).

## Scope
The apps' code contains various examples of patterns related to UI composition, dependency injection and state management specific to Flutter, SwiftUI and UIKit frameworks. Its purpose is to offer a base for comparing those frameworks.

**Note!** The project's main purpose is merely to reveal some of the differences and similarities across frameworks. It was made in a short time and shouldn't be regarded as a production level code nor a definitive guide for best practices.

## Running the apps
* For SwiftUI and UIKit apps a Mac computer with Xcode will be needed to run the apps.
* The Flutter app can be run on a Mac or Windows machine with Flutter SDK installed.
